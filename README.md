# A Supervised Machine Learning Approach To Credit Card Fraud Detection
An ML Project where I built and evaluated Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

Dataset contained 284,807 instances and 0.17% true positives.

Here's [the report](https://github.com/adedamola26/creditCardFraudDetectionSystem/blob/main/Adedamola_Adesoye_002707831-analysis.pdf), the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adedamola26/creditCardFraudDetectionSystem/blob/main/creditCardFraud.ipynb) and the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?search=zero).
